For the hackathon Junction 2022 we are tackeling the challenge "Keep calm and don't panic". The idea is to build a digital personal diary that does automated sentiment analysis.

## Challenge

* Prevent and aid mental health and wellbeing struggles of young adults.
* Many of us know someone who is struggling with their mental health or wellbeing, or even struggling to understand themselves, and it is time to get rid of the stigma that comes with those challenges ‚Äì they are hard enough as it is.
* We want you to create an innovative solution to help young adults with their mental health and wellbeing.
* It should be something original, that you can't find a dozen solutions to with a simple Google search.
* Your project should take the specific needs of the users into consideration, be convenient to use, and provide insights that could help prevent mental health problems or aid with ongoing struggles.
* It can be purely for individual use, include collaboration tools with peers, or it can involve healthcare professionals in some way.
* Because we would be dealing with personal information we want the security and privacy to be top notch!
* And using juicy technologies such as Rust, serverless, AI or AR is optional, but appreciated!

## Idea

**Personal diary with sentiment analysis and optional speech to text.**

* Personal dairy
* Web app that can record speech
* Web app translates spoken words to text
* Sentiment analysis of text (positive, negative, ‚Ä¶)
* App visualizes the mood in a calendar or timeline

Optionally:

* Professional can have a dashboard of these mood graphs to see the big picture.
* Potential name: ‚ÄúMood barometer‚Äù

### MVP

1. Webapp with text-input-area.
2. You input some sentences.
3. There is a button to click.
4. On button click the text is sent to the backend for sentiment analysis.
5. The sentiment analysis score is then displayed.
6. There is a back button to repeat the analysis and reset the web app.
